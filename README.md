# Scene Tile Map Layer

⚠️**WARNING:** This plugin is under development.
It is unfinished, has limitations, and may contain potential bugs.

Scene Tile Map Layer is a plugin for Godot that provides an alternative approach to placing scenes on a tilemap. Instead of abstract tiles, the plugin places full scenes on the map, creating real node instances. This allows working with their properties, state, and logic directly.

The plugin adds a `SceneTileMapLayer` node, which replicates the functionality of `TileMapLayer`, adapting it for scenes.

The project is in a proof-of-concept state. The implementation serves as a demonstration of the idea and requires further development, optimization, and testing.
